# System and Network Administration. init
This first project, init, will give you the opportunity to discover system and network
basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few ideas of
scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily basis.

##### Project includes three parts:
1. Network
2. System
3. Scripting

I'm using MacOS for Network and Debian for System and Scripting.
